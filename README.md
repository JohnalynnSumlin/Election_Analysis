# Election_Analysis

## Overview / Purpose
Congratulations! You’ve helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. But wait! The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout

Working from this module’s election_results.csv file, use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file.

Finally, you’ll provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.
